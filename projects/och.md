OCH has been a long-time client of [Turtledove Clemens](http://www.turtledove.com). Their website has gradually changed over the years to take advantage of modern design and web standards. In the summer of 2012 I redesigned their website from dreary and drab, to bright, vibrant and friendly.

In addition to their main website, we added a blog to help improve their customer engagment and help them target search terms for services they may not offer yet. The blog is built on WordPress and takes full advantage of Responsive Web Design ([#RWD](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RWD)).

In 2013, OCH needed short [automotive service videos](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPFlWJONMqj8Yo_MDqC81OB2n2A5jilKC) that emphasized the value to customers of having trained technicians work on their vehicles.

The mobile and desktop websites frequently geotarget regions to show special offers to visitors in Idaho, Arizona, Colorado and more often than not, various parts of Oregon.
