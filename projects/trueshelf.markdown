* **Project Type:** Design, Front-End Development
* **[Visit Website](http://www.trueshelf.com)**

TrueShelf was created by [Shiva Kintali](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~kintali/), an instructor at Princeton University, who had collected mathematical exercises during his time teaching at GeorgiaTech.

The goal of TrueShelf is to aid both instructors and students by presenting quality exercises with tag-based indexing.

TrueShelf uses [Askbot](http://askbot.com), which is built on Python/Django, as its foundation. Most of the Q&A features of the Askbot have been stripped down or out all together while emphasizing social activities such as "liking" and commenting.

This new design attempts to solidify TrueShelf as a social search engine of mathematical exercises, notes, videos and problem sets while establishing a pleasing visual tone.

Thank you !!!
