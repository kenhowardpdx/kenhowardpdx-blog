* **Project Type:** Design, Development
* **[Visit Website](http://www.brockamp-jaeger.com)**

Brockamp &amp; Jaeger approached [Turtledove Clemens](http://www.turtledove.com) looking to have their outdated website replaced with something more appealing, search engine friendly and easy to maintain.

We evaluated all areas in which their website could assist them in their normal day-to-day operations. The result was to provide them a complete web solution with WordPress as the foundation. This website allows for easy upload of new projects, customer reviews, photos, and so much more.

**This project included:**

* Professional &amp; Responsive Website Design
* Simple Project Management with a password protected section for subcontractors.
* Print or Email projects directly from a project page (activated by pressing Alt+Shift+B)
* Enhanced slider with project details
* Custom fields for projects and staff
* Search Engine Optimization & Directory Submissions
