title: Committing to Blogging At Least One Day a Week
summary: I've been lucky enough to work in an industry where I literally learn something new every single day. And I regularly put it to use in my work. But, one thing I've always neglected is sharing what I've learned with others so they can benefit from my knowledge.

Blogging hasn't come natural to me. I'm not a writer. I prefer to design and code websites rather than write about designing and coding websites.

Although I prefer 'doing' over 'teaching', I find myself repeatedly searching for the same information. I can remember a Google Search more than the site I ultimately selected with the solution to my problem. And as the Internet expands, I'll need to find a better way to query known information.

And guess what... Notebooks aren't a solution either. Once a notebook is full, it's either filed away or trashed. All of the information is locked in this catalog of the past.

That is why I'm committing myself to write at least one new blog post a week. Don't believe me? Yeah, me neither. But I really should. This is week 2 of my commitment. So far, so good.
